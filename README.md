# JSON Formatter and Validator
A simple JSON pretty-printer/formatter+validator made with JavaFX

## Project highlights
1. Both the formatter and validator are written from scratch, without using a built-in/third party JSON parsing utilities
2. The parser implemented is a Recursive Descent parser. It outputs true/false depending on whether a given JSON string is valid or not. It also builds an Abstract Syntax Tree through which we can generate a treelike preview of the JSON data.
3. The application includes, formatting & validating JSON either stored in a file or pasted in the input field. It also supports previewing the data, copying raw text to clipboard and saving the result to another file.
